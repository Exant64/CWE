The code is messy, because of it being a result of 4+ years of learning and personal growth in terms of programming, but it is what it is.

The commits are wiped due to them being basically unusable (meaningless "something" type of commit messages, commits that don't compile etc), as said earlier the whole project is a soup of experimentation.
The original repo will be uploaded as an archive eventually.

Requirements to compile: 
- Project currently uses VS 2022 (toolset v143)
- DX9 (DXSDK_DIR environment variable)
- SA2_PATH environment variable for debugging and output directory (this could be solved with a symlink or something down the line)

Issues and PRs are welcome, I'll try and get around to them when I can, for now the project became open source mainly to be a resource to other modders.

Since this is a new repo, the old contributions are gone so credit to DarkyBenji (original creator of CWE) for rewriting his old More Chao Animation code in here, and of course credit to all the contributors to the whole project, list on GameBanana page.
